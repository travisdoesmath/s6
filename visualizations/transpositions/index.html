            There's something mathematically interesting about the way you can rearrange 6 items. We're going to 
            explore the <em>outer automorphism</em> of the symmetric group on 6 elements. If you're already
            familiar with permutations and group theory, skip ahead to the <a href="#lets-go">"For you to think about"</a> section.

            If you're not familiar with these concepts, don't worry! Expand the next section for a gentle introduction to 
            groups, symmetry, and permutations.

            <p>
                When mathematicians talk about <em>rearranging</em>, we call it <em>permuting</em>, and we 
                consider all possible rearrangements as <em>permutations</em>. We also have a way of 
                organizing these permutations called <em>groups</em>. When you first learn algebra,
                you learn how to do (and undo!) operations on numbers like addition and multiplication.
                Groups are abstractions that capture the essence of these operations. With those abstractions,
                you can look at underlying patterns and structures and see where they might apply. This
                is part of why math can be so powerful; when we take something we're familiar with, abstract
                that structure and apply it to something unfamiliar, we can unlock new insights and understandings.
            </p>
            <h2>An semi-formal definition of a group</h2>
            <p>There is a formal definition of a group in abstract algebra, but here, we'll talk about it in more informal language</p>
            <p>
                We'll consider a group to be a collection of actions that can be performed on some set of items. The actions
                must satisfy three properties:
                <ul>
                <li>Closure: for any two actions in the group, performing one after the other results in another action in the group.</li>
                <li>Identity: there is an action in the group that does nothing</li>
                <li>Inverses: for each action in the group, doing the action in reverse is also in the group</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's consider these properties with a group we're already familiar with: the integers with addition.
                <ul>
                <li>Closure: adding any two integers always results in another integer</li>
                <li>Identity: adding zero to any integer does not change its value</li>
                <li>Inverses: for any integer, there is also the negative of that integer</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <section id="think-about-1" class="green aside">    
                <h2>For you to think about</h2>
                <p>Which of the following satisfy the group properties? If they don't, which property do they fail?
                <ul>
                    <li>Even integers with addition</li>
                    <li>Odd integers with addition</li>
                    <li>Positive integers with addition</li>
                    <li>Integers with multiplication</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

            <h2>Groups and Symmetry</h2>
            <p>
                Now, let's take that understanding of groups and apply it to a different context.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider a square. What are all the ways we can move it so that it looks exactly the same as when we started? We can:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Rotate it 90°, 180°, or 270° clockwise</li>
                <li>Flip it horizontally or vertically</li>
                <li>Flip it along either diagonal</li>
                <li>Leave it as is (the identity transformation)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These eight transformations form a group! Let's verify the properties:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Closure: performing any two of these transformations always results in another transformation in our list</li>
                <li>Identity: leaving the square as is (doing nothing) is in our list</li>
                <li>Inverses: each transformation can be undone by another transformation in our list</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We call these actions the <em>symmetries</em> of the square, and the group they form is called 
                the <em>dihedral group of order 8</em>, often denoted D4. This is an example of a 
                <em>symmetry group</em>, which is a group that describes the symmetries of a geometric object.
            </p>
            <p>Groups are a natural way to understand symmetry.</p>
