        <h1>The Weird Symmetry of Shuffling Six Items</h1>
        <p>
            When mathematicians consider shuffling items, there's something strangely unique about shuffling <em>precisely six items</em>. 
            In fact, mathematicians refer to it as "exceptional" or "exotic". 
        </p>
        <h2>Permutations</h2>
        <p>
            First, let's talk about shuffling. In the world of math, we call any rearrangement of items a <em>permutation</em>. 
            Below is an interactive diagram where you can click on any two numbers to swap them. Note that any possible arrangement 
            can be achieved by a series of swaps (which are formerly called "transpositions"). 
        </p>
        <figure>
            <svg id="permutations" viewBox="-50 -25 100 50">
            </svg>
            <figcaption>Permutations (click on any two numbers to swap them)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            In the figure above, we're also using a compact notation called "cycle notation" to describe the permutation. Transpositions
            are cycles that look like (1 2), which means that 1 and 2 switch places. A cycle like (1 2 3) means that 1 goes to where 2 was, 
            2 goes to where 3 was, and 3 goes to where 1 was. We can get to the cycle (1 2 3) by performing the swap (1 2) followed by (2 3).
            A permutation can have disjoint cycles too, like (1 2)(3 4), which means that 1 and 2 swap places and 3 and 4 swap places.
            Note, while the figure is animating, the cycle notation will take on the longer form like (1 2)(2 3), and then when it finishes,
            it will simplify to the fully reduced form (1 2 3).            
        </p>

        <h2>Group Theory</h2>
        <p>
            Permutations behave in a way that mathematicians abstract into a concept called a <em>group</em>. If I ask you a concrete algebra
            problem like, "2 * (5 + x) = 8" and ask you to solve for x, you're taking advantage of a lot of abstract qualities, like the fact
            that addition and multiplication are associative, that multiplication distributes over addition, that there are numbers that 
            "do nothing" for a given operation (like 0 for addition), and that every number has an "undo" operation that gets it back
            to the "do nothing" number (like if I give you the number 5, you can add -5 to get back to 0). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Group theory comes from a field of math called "abstract algebra", which is all about defining and understanding all of those
            abstract qualities outside of a concrete example. A group is one of the simplest abstract algebraic structures, and it has 
            just a few rules:
            <ul>
                <li>There's a set of elements with an associative operation (like addition or multiplication),</li>
                <li>There's an identity element (the "do nothing" number), </li>
                <li>Every element has an inverse (an "undo" operation), and</li>
                <li>You can't get something outside of the set by applying the operation.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Group theory is the natural mathematical language of symmetry. Think of bilateral symmetry as a group with two permutations:
            <ul>
                <ol>1: Do nothing.</ol>
                <ol>2: Flip left and right.</ol>
            </ul>
            More generally, "symmetry" means all the ways that you can manipulate something and have it look the same as when you started.
            For example, a rubik's cube can be mixed up in a huge number of ways, but each arrangement is still a "rubik's cube". Rotating
            a face of the cube "permutes" the position of the cubies.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <svg id="triangle" viewBox="-50 -25 100 50">
            </svg>
            <figcaption>TODO: Symmetries of a triangle as a group</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            With permutations, the elements are the different items being arranged, and the operation is performing one permutation after 
            another. The identity element is to make no changes, every permutation can be undone, and there's no way to perform a series of
            permutations and end up with something that isn't a permutation. So permutations form a group! In fact, for any finite group,
            it can be considered as a subgroup of permutations.
        </p>
        <h2>Groups as Other Groups, Groups as Parts of Other Groups</h2>
        <p>
            Groups show up all over the place, and sometimes two different situations have the "same" group. For example, all of the ways
            to flip and rotate a triangle acts the same as all of the ways to permute three items. To show two groups are the same, we
            need to find a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two groups that preserves the group rules. So, if the 
            correspondence maps "2" to "B", then it must also map the inverse of "2" to the inverse of "B", and it must map "2 * 3" to 
            "B * C". This is called an isomorphism. We can also find a group inside of another group. Think of permuting four objects: if 
            you just ignore one item, then it's like there's a copy of the 3-object permutation group inside of the 4-object permutation group. 
            This is called a subgroup.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <svg id="s3" viewBox="-50 -25 100 50">
            </svg>
            <figcaption>TODO: S_3 as symmetries of triangle</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            When we consider all of the ways to permute n items, we call that "the symmetric group on n items", and we write it as S_n.
            Every symmetric group has subgroups of all the smaller symmetric groups. Like our example above, S_4 contains S_3, which contains
            S_2 (which is the same as the bilateral symmetry group).
        </p>
        <h2>Groups as Themselves?</h2>
        <p>
            We can also consider all the ways that a group can be mapped to itself. For symmetric groups, think of this as relabeling.
            The permutation group on the set {1, 2, 3, 4} is the same as the permutation group on the set {A, B, C, D}, and there's a 
            natural way to map between them (A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4), but nothing says we have to keep the same labels. Maybe you think 
            A, B, C, and D should be 3, 1, 4, 2. This is just as valid, because it's just changing the labels. Both are called "automorphisms",
            because they're isomorphisms from the group to itself. 
        </p>
        <h2>The Exceptional Symmetry of S_6</h2>
        <p>
            Now we get to the weird part. For almost every symmetric group, the only automorphisms are "relabelings". In other words, any map
            from the group to itself that preserves the group structure is just a relabeling of the items. But there is exactly one exception:
            S_6, the permutation group on six items, has an automorphism that is not a relabeling. This is called an "outer automorphism", 
            and because it is the exception to the rule, it's called the "exceptional outer automorphism".
        </p>
        <p>
            The following diagram has two rows of 6 items, the permutations between them are linked by the outer automorphism of S_6. 
            Click on any two items in either row to see how they affect the other row.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <svg id="linked-permutations" viewBox="-50 -25 100 50">
            </svg>
            <figcaption>Linked Permutations</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>Finding the Execeptional Automorphism</h2>
        <p>
            The key to finding the exceptional outer automorphism of S_6 is to embed S_5 into S_6 in a special way. We already know that
            S_5 has a "natural" embedding into S_6, which we can think of as fixing one item and permuting the other five. But there's 
            another way to embed S_5 into S_6 that acts "transitively" on all six items. This means that if you start with any item, you 
            can get to any other item by applying some embedded permutation. This is the key to the exceptional outer automorphism of S_6.
            Now, we talk about "the" exceptional outer automorphism of S_6, but when you want to write it out explicitly, there are actually 720
            ways to do it. The outer automorphism isn't just a relabeling, but you can relabel the outer automorphism to get "another" outer 
            automorphism. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Otto Hölder showed one way to construct the transitive embedding of S_5 into S_6 (and therefore the exceptional outer 
            automorphism) using "pentads, "synthemes" and "duads". 
        </p>
        <p>
            A "duad" is just a pair of items, like {1, 2}. There are 15 possible duads: 
            <div class="table-3-col">
                <div>1 2</div>
                <div>1 3</div>
                <div>1 4</div>
                <div>1 5</div>
                <div>1 6</div>

                <div>2 3</div>
                <div>2 4</div>
                <div>2 5</div>
                <div>2 6</div>
                <div>3 4</div>

                <div>3 5</div>
                <div>3 6</div>
                <div>4 5</div>
                <div>4 6</div>
                <div>5 6</div>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            A "syntheme" is a set of three duads that account for all six items (like {1, 2}, {3, 4}, and {5, 6}). There are also 15 possible 
            synthemes, (and for a lovely exploration of the duality between them, check out <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/six.html">John Baez's 
            thoughts on the number 6</a>):
            <div class="table-3-col">
                <div>1 2 / 3 4 / 5 6</div>
                <div>1 2 / 3 5 / 4 6</div>
                <div>1 2 / 3 6 / 4 5</div>

                <div>1 3 / 2 4 / 5 6</div>
                <div>1 3 / 2 5 / 4 6</div>
                <div>1 3 / 2 6 / 4 5</div>

                <div>1 4 / 2 3 / 5 6</div>
                <div>1 4 / 2 5 / 3 6</div>
                <div>1 4 / 2 6 / 3 5</div>

                <div>1 5 / 2 3 / 4 6</div>
                <div>1 5 / 2 4 / 3 6</div>
                <div>1 5 / 2 6 / 3 4</div>

                <div>1 6 / 2 3 / 4 5</div>
                <div>1 6 / 2 4 / 3 5</div>
                <div>1 6 / 2 5 / 3 4</div>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, a "pentad" is a set of five synthemes that together contain all 15 possible duads. There are exactly six pentads. 
            The fact that there are six pentads with five synthemes gives us the embedding of S_5 into S_6. In the following figure, 
            each pentad sorts the synthemes by the duad that fixes the number 6. This gives a natural correspondence to label the synthemes
            1 through 5.
        </p>
        <p>
            Click on any two synthemes to see how the transposition from S_5 maps to an action permuting the six pentads. Note that every 
            transposition acts on all six pentads, so this is a transitive embedding of S_5 into S_6.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <svg id="pentads" viewBox="-50 -25 100 75">
            </svg>
            <figcaption>Pentads</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Specifically, what's happening here is that the permutation from S_5 is being applied as a relabeling to the numbers in the synthemes. 
            From these pentads, you can work out where a permutation of S_5 will send each of the six pentads by seeing which pentad it matches 
            after the relabeling. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But, frankly, I don't find this very satisfying at all, and I think we can do better.
        </p>
        <h2>Mystic Pentagons</h2>
        <p>
            In the paper "A Description of the Outer Automorphism of S_6, and the Invariants of Six Points in Projective Space" by Howard, 
            Millson, Snowden, and Vakil, they describe a more visual approach using "mystic pentagons".
        </p>
        <p>
            Before we get to pentagons, lets talk cycles again. How many ways can you cycle through 5 elements?
        </p>
        <p>
            If we just go in order, you can start at 1, go to 2, then 3, 4, 5, and cycle back to 1. We're going to consider this the same as
            starting at 2, going to 3, then 4, 5, 1, and back to 2. In cycle notation, (1 2 3 4 5) is the same as (2 3 4 5 1), so we start with
            the smallest element in each cycle. So all 5-cycles will start with 1. We have 4 choices for the next element, then 3 choices 
            for the next, then 2 choices, and finally only 1 choice for the last element. This gives us 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 possible 5-cycles. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, for the mystic pentagons, we're also going to ignore direction. So (1 2 3 4 5) is the same as (1 5 4 3 2). 
            Now there are only 12 distinct 5-cycles. Finally, each 5-cycle has a unique complementary 5-cycle that doesn't share any edges.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, (1 2 3 4 5) uses the edges 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, and 5-1. Starting at 1, our choices are either 1-3 or 1-4. Let's pick 1-3.
            Then from 3, our only choice is 3-5, then 5-2, 2-4, and finally 4-1 (or 1-4). This gives us the complementary cycle (1 3 5 2 4), which
            recall we're also associating the reverse cycle (1 4 2 5 3) with. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This gives us our "mystic pentagons". There are six ways to pair up complementary 5-cycles, and we can visualize them as colorings
            on the edges of a complete graph on five vertices (that's just a fancy way of saying "draw all the lines between five points"). Now, 
            keep in mind, the specific colors of the pentagon don't matter, it's just that each edge is either one or the other. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If we permute the vertices of the pentagon, then we will need to permute the six mystic pentagons to get back to the original
            layout. This gives us our transitive embedding of S_5 into S_6.
        </p>
        <p>
            Click on any two vertices to see how the transposition from S_5 maps to an action permuting the six mystic pentagons. Note that every 
            transposition acts on all six pentads, so this is a transitive embedding of S_5 into S_6.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <svg id="mystic" viewBox="-50 -25 100 50">
            </svg>
            <figcaption>Mystic Pentagons</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            This is better, but there's still something that bugs me. Which vertex should be 1? Which mystic pentagon should be first? One's 
            choice here is essentially an arbitrary labeling, and after staring at the mystic pentagons for a while, I think there's a more
            natural visualization. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There's one mystic pentagon that has 5-fold symmetry, and the rest only have bilateral symmetry. This suggests to me that we
            can make an arrangement five pentagons around one central pentagon. This is visualized in the following figure.
